# Goal Setter App

This project was built with an intention to go over the ExpressJs , Mongoose , Redux and Netlify Serverless Functions.
Also added a hint of neo brutalism style to the UI. ðŸ˜‰

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Install the dependencies.

### `npm install netlify-cli -g`
Install netlify-cli globally to develop and deploy the serverless react app.

### `netlify init`

### `netlify dev`
To test out the app, netlify will detect the underlying framework and run it along with the serverless functions.


#### To deploy , just push your code to Github and link with netlfiy, netlfiy should automatically detect the functions and dploy your site.
